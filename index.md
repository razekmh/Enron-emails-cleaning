## Background
This is the story of cleaning Enron email dataset. My aim of downloading and
cleaning this dataset is to use it as an example in a workshop about databases
and analysis. 

The dataset is offered by CMU [here](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~enron/). 
You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/razekmh/Enron-emails-cleaning/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.


first install ansible
apt-get install ansible

then install ansible extensions
ansible-galaxy collection install community.docker


Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/razekmh/Enron-emails-cleaning/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
